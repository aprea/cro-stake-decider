### What is this?

This website compares the rewards and benefits of an active Crypto.com card stake compared to Crypto.org chain DeFi staking.

### Who is this website for?

This website is for Crypto.com users with an **unlocked card stake** who want to compare the value of their card benefits against the potential returns of staking their CRO via the Crypto.org chain.

### How do I use this website?

Follow these four simple steps:

1.  Select your current Crypto.com card (e.g. Ruby, Jade Green, Icy White, etc.
2.  Enter the total amount of CRO staked for your card (can be found in the Crypto.com app).
3.  Select the services you use. Only select services that are linked to your Crypto.com card.
4.  Enter the amount you spend per month on your Crypto.com card. Make sure to select your local currency.

Once you have entered all of your information, you will see the results in the results section.

### What is the Crypto.org chain?

Crypto.org Chain is a public, open-source and permissionless blockchain - a fully decentralized network with high speed and low fees, designed to be a public good that helps drive mass adoption of blockchain technology through use cases like Payments, DeFi and NFTs.

### What is Crypto.org chain staking?

Crypto.org chain users can delegate their native CRO tokens to a trusted Validator. Validators run nodes to validate transactions on the Crypto.org Chain network and in return earn block rewards in CRO, which are then distributed to the Delegators after taking a Validator commission.

### Is this website safe to use?

Put simply, yes. This website doesn't store any data. We do not send your data to a backend server. The code is fully open source (you can check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aprea/cro-stake-decider)). This website doesn't use cookies or track analytics data.

You can even use this website in airplane/offline mode, all the calculations take place locally in your browser.

### Some of the values look incorrect

This is because the calculations are based on hardcoded values, e.g. CRO USD price, Crypto.org Staking APR, currency pair rates, etc.

You can adjust these values yourself by clicking the setting button (cog icon) located in the navigation bar.
